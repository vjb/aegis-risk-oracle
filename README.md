# 🛡️ Aegis Risk Oracle

**The Intelligent Guardrail for the Agent Economy**

AI-Powered Risk Assessment Oracle for DeFi Agents using Chainlink CRE.
Aegis is a production-ready risk oracle that prevents AI agents from executing scam trades by analyzing token security, detecting price manipulation, and providing cryptographically-signed risk assessments.

## 🎯 Problem

AI agents executing autonomous trades lack safeguards against **honeypots**, **price manipulation**, and **contract malice**. Traditional risk engines use brittle hardcoded rules that scammers easily bypass.

**Aegis Solution:** A decentralized **Orchestration Layer** that synthesizes multiple risk signals and provides cryptographically-signed verdicts. It acts as a middleware **Safeguard**, blocking malicious transactions *before* they hit the blockchain.

        CRE->>APIs: CoinGecko (Price)

```

### The Triple Lock Standard
Signatures bind verdicts to **Identity** (user), **Value** (price), and **Time** (5-min expiry) — matching CRE institutional security.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup

Before running the Quick Start, ensure your environment is ready.

1.  **System Requirements:** Node.js 18+, Docker Desktop, and Foundry (for Anvil).
2.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/vjb/aegis-risk-oracle`
3.  **Secrets Configuration (CRITICAL):**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # ⚠️ Open .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

> *⚠️ **Note for Mac/Linux Users:** This project uses PowerShell for automation. However, you can run the core verification logic directly via Docker using these commands:*
>
> **1. Run CRE Simulation (AI Risk Logic):**
> `docker exec aegis_dev sh -c "cd /app && cre workflow simulate ./aegis-workflow --target staging-settings --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload /app/tests/payloads/test-payload-pass.json"`
>
> **2. Verify Cryptography (Triple Lock):**
> `docker exec aegis_dev sh -c "cd /app/aegis-workflow && bun run verify-signature.ts"`

**1. THE UBER TESTER (Verify ALL systems in one command)**
```powershell
.\test-everything.ps1 # 🛡️ Environment → APIs → Crypto → Contract → E2E
```

**2. Full E2E Demo (AI → Signature → Blockchain)**
```powershell
.\run-full-flow.ps1   # 🚀 Complete integration: CRE analysis -> Anvil execution
```

**3. Visual Demo Suite (Frontend + ElizaOS)**
```powershell
.\start-aegis.ps1     # Frontend: localhost:3005, Backend: localhost:3011
.\stop-aegis.ps1      # Stop all services
```

---

## 🎬 E2E Demo Showcase

`run-full-flow.ps1` demonstrates the complete integration:

**🚀 AEGIS FULL E2E DEMO: AI → SIGNATURE → BLOCKCHAIN**

* **Step 1:** ✅ Prerequisites (Anvil, Docker, Contract)
* **Step 2:** 🧠 AI Risk Analysis (Chainlink CRE)
* **Step 3:** 🔐 Signed Transaction Prep
* **Step 4:** ⛓️ On-Chain Execution (Anvil)
* **Step 5:** 🛡️ Replay Attack Prevention

**Result:** Proves full stack integration with live demo.

* AI analysis flows directly to blockchain execution.
* Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering.
* Replay attacks are blocked by the contract.
* No manual copy-paste needed — fully automated.

---

## 🌐 Visual Dashboard (Simulation Mode)

`start-aegis.ps1` launches the visual demo stack (No blockchain required):

**1. Frontend (`localhost:3005`) - The "Movie Set"**

* **What it is:** A React/Next.js "Mission Control" dashboard.
* **What it does:** Visualizes the risk scanning process.
* **Note:** This is a *simulation* UI. It doesn't connect to the local Anvil chain yet. It's designed to show *intent* and *user experience*.

**2. Backend (`localhost:3011`) - The Brain (ElizaOS)**

* **What it is:** An ElizaOS agent server running the "Aegis" character.
* **What it does:** Processes natural language chat, triggers the CRE risk analysis workflow, and returns the verdict.

**Demo Flow:**

1. User inputs token address in frontend.
2. ElizaOS agent receives intent → triggers CRE workflow.
3. Risk verdict appears in real-time feed.
4. Frontend shows APPROVE/REJECT decision with score.

## 🛠️ Chainlink CRE Development

**For judges and developers verifying the CRE workflow specifically:**

### 1. Run CRE Simulation (Manual)
Run the Chainlink runtime environment simulation directly via Docker:

```powershell
# Run a PASS scenario (Low risk)
docker exec aegis_dev sh -c "cd /app && cre workflow simulate ./aegis-workflow --target staging-settings --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload /app/tests/payloads/test-payload-pass.json"

# Run a FAIL scenario (High risk / Honeypot)
docker exec aegis_dev sh -c "cd /app && cre workflow simulate ./aegis-workflow --target staging-settings --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload /app/tests/payloads/test-payload-fail.json"
```

<details>

```

</details>

### 2. Run Component Tests
These scripts isolate specific parts of the Chainlink workflow:

```powershell
# 🧠 Verify AI Logic & CRE Workflow (Mocked Input)
.\test-aegis.ps1

# 🔐 Verify Off-Chain Cryptography (Signatures & Replay Protection)
.\test-signature.ps1
```

## 🛡️ Security & Verification

Aegis implements a **Verifiable AI Shield** through three primary mechanisms:

### 1. The Triple Lock Standard

Every risk verdict is cryptographically bound to three immutable factors:

* **Identity:** Bound to the user's wallet address.
* **Value:** Bound to the current asset price at the time of analysis.
* **Time:** 5-minute expiry to prevent using stale risk data.

### 2. Trust Architecture: The Signer & The Vault

Aegis uses standard asymmetric cryptography to bridge the "Off-Chain" and "On-Chain" worlds trustlessly.

* **Off-Chain (The Signer):** The Chainlink CRE environment holds a secure **Private Key**. Once the AI Risk Officer calculates a verdict, the CRE signs a hash of the data using this private key. This ensures the data originated from the trusted Aegis hardware and hasn't been tampered with.
* **On-Chain (The Vault):** The `AegisVault.sol` smart contract is deployed with the corresponding **Public Key**. When the agent submits the transaction, the contract uses `ecrecover` to compare the signature against the stored Public Key. If it doesn't match, the transaction reverts immediately.

### 3. Replay Protection

The smart contract tracks assessment hashes to ensure each signed risk verdict is used **exactly once**, preventing attackers from recycling old approvals.

## 🧪 Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Verdict | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **WETH (Base)** | ✅ **EXECUTE** | Low risk, fair price. |
| **Honeypot** | ❌ **REJECT** | `is_honeypot: true` detected externally. |
| **Manipulation** | ❌ **REJECT** | Price >50% over market. |
| **Composite** | ❌ **REJECT** | AI: High-value + Proxy/Mintable flags. |

## 🔗 Chainlink Integrations (Judge's Guide)

Per the **Risk & Compliance Track** requirements, here are the direct links to the core Chainlink components acting as the **Orchestration Layer**:

* **[aegis-workflow/main.ts](./aegis-workflow/main.ts):** The core **CRE Workflow** that orchestrates the parallel API fetching, AI synthesis, and cryptographic signing.
* **[contracts/AegisVault.sol](./contracts/AegisVault.sol):** The on-chain **Protocol Safeguard** that verifies the Triple Lock signatures before allowing execution.
* **[project.yaml](./project.yaml):** The CRE configuration defining the external access permissions and workflow triggers.
* **[aegis-workflow/verify-signature.ts](./aegis-workflow/verify-signature.ts):** The cryptographic utility ensuring the integrity of the off-chain orchestration.

## 🔮 Next Steps: The Cross-Chain "Aegis Hub"

Aegis is architected as a **Universal Risk Oracle**. Because the risk assessment happens off-chain in the secure Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), the **same** cryptographic signature can secure AI agents across any EVM chain.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User["AI Agent"] -->|Request Risk Check| Hub["🛡️ Aegis Hub (Chainlink CRE)"]
    
    subgraph "Aegis Hub"
    Hub -->|1. Fetch Price| CG["CoinGecko"]
    Hub -->|2. Check Security| GP["GoPlus"]
    Hub -->|3. Generate Entropy| QRNG["Quantum Source"]
    Hub -->|4. Sign Verdict| Signer["🔑 Universal Signer Key"]
    end
    
    Signer -->|Signed Verdict| Base["🔵 Base (AegisVault)"]
    Signer -->|Signed Verdict| Arb["Any L2 (AegisVault)"]
    Signer -->|Signed Verdict| Opt["🔴 Optimism (AegisVault)"]
    
    Base -->|Execute| Uniswap
    Arb -->|Execute| Camelot
    Opt -->|Execute| Velodrome
```

**Why this wins:**
1.  **Unified Security Policy:** One risk engine protects billions in liquidity across all chains.
2.  **Zero Bridging Latency:** The signature is generated off-chain and submitted directly to the destination chain.
3.  **Historical Audits (The Graph):** We will index `VerdictExecuted` events to create a permanent, queryable history of all AI agent decisions for compliance reporting.
