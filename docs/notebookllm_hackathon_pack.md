**Use these prompts to generate your winning submission materials.**

## 1. 📹 The Video Overview (The Script)
**Goal:** A high-impact 3-minute video script.

**Prompt:**
> Act as a creative director for a winning hackathon presentation. Based on the uploaded sources (`README.md`, `demo_script.md`), write a tightly paced **3-minute Video Script** for "Aegis Risk Oracle".
>
> **Structure:**
> 1.  **The Hook (0:00-0:30):** Use the "Audio Script Verbatim" provided below.
> 2.  **The Solution (0:30-1:00):** Explain the "Triple Lock" (Identity, Value, Time).
> 3.  **The Demo (1:00-2:30):** Narrate the "Happy Path" (User buys AVAX -> Green Badge) and the "Live Fire" (User buys Scam -> Red Block).
> 4.  **The Tech Stack (2:30-3:00):** Mention Chainlink CRE, ElizaOS, and the "Universal Risk Hub" architecture.
>
> **Tone:** Professional, urgent, and innovative.

### 🎙️ Audio Script Verbatim (Read this yourself or generate AI voice)
*"We are entering the era of the Agent Economy. Soon, AI will control billions in on-chain liquidity. But LLMs hallucinate. They get tricked. They don't understand 'Honeypots' or 'Slippage'. Without a kill switch, an AI agent is just a wallet waiting to be drained."*

*"Enter Aegis. The first cryptographically secure Risk Oracle for AI agents. We don't just 'ask' the AI if a trade is safe. We prove it."*

*"This isn't a simulation. The verdict you see on screen is signed by a Decentralized Oracle Network. If the signature doesn't match, the smart contract literally refuses to execute. Aegis doesn't just suggest safety; it enforces it."*

## 2. 📊 The Infographic (The Architecture)
**Goal:** Visualize the "Universal Risk Oracle" flow.

**Prompt:**
> Create a detailed **Visual Description** for an infographic titled "The Aegis Universal Risk Hub".
>
> **Visual Flow:**
> 1.  **Left Side (Input):** Show an "AI Agent" sending a raw text intent (e.g., "Buy 100 ETH").
> 2.  **Center (The Brain):** A large, glowing node labeled "Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)". Inside, show three parallel streams merging:
>     *   "CoinGecko" (Price Data)
>     *   "GoPlus" (Security Scan)
> 3.  **The Lock:** Show a "Cryptographic Key" stamping a document. Label this "Triple Lock Signature".
> 4.  **Right Side (Output):** Show arrows branching out to multiple blockchains (Base, Optimism, Arbitrum). Show a "Smart Vault" on each chain unlocking only when it sees the stamped document.
>
> **Caption:** "One Signer. Any Chain. Universal Security."

## 3. 📑 The Slide Deck (The Pitch)
**Goal:** Outline a winning 5-slide pitch deck.

**Prompt:**
> Create a **Slide-by-Slide Outline** for a 5-slide Hackathon Pitch Deck.
>
> **Slide 1: The Problem**
> Title: "The Agent Alignment Problem"
> Bullet points: AI Agents are autonomous but gullible; Existing risk tools are fragmented; Losing funds kills adoption.
>
> **Slide 2: The Solution**
> Title: "Aegis: The Compliance Layer"
> Graphic idea: A shield protecting a robot.
> Key Stat: "Triple Lock Security - Identity, Value, Time".
>
> **Slide 3: How It Works (The Tech)**
> Title: "Powered by Chainlink CRE"
> Focus: Off-chain computation (Python/TS) -> On-chain verification (Solidity).
> Mention: "Zero-Latency Bridging" via signatures.
>
> **Slide 4: The Live Demo**
> Title: "Mission Control"
> Content: Screenshot of the "Signed by AEGIS" badge.
> Quote: "Real-time, cryptographically verified risk assessment."
>
> **Slide 5: The Future**
> Title: "Universal Risk Hub"
> Roadmap: Mainnet launch, Cross-chain expansion (Base/Op/Arb via CCIP), "The Graph" integration for historical audits.
