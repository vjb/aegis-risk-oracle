# 🏆 Aegis Protocol: Hackathon Demo Script

## 🎭 The Narrative
"Aegis is the **Compliance Layer for AI Agents**. We stop AI hallucinations from draining your wallet by enforcing **cryptographic rules** on every transaction."

---

## 🟢 Scenario 1: The "Happy Path" (Visual Trust)
**Goal:** Show that Aegis is a real-time security engine, not just a chatbot.

1.  **Open the UI:** Ensure `http://localhost:3005` is loaded.
2.  **The Hook:** "Watch the Mission Control panel on the right. This is the Chainlink Runtime Environment thinking in real-time."
3.  **Action:** Type:
    ```
    buy avax
    ```
4.  **Narration (while scanning):**
    *   "First, it checks **CoinGecko** for price deviations."
    *   "Now it's running a **GoPlus Security** scan for honeypots."
    *   "Finally, it verifies **Liquidity Depth** to prevent slippage."
5.  **The Climax:**
    *   Wait for the **Green Verdict Card** to appear.
    *   **Point to it:** "See that? **'Cryptographically Signed by AEGIS'**. That means a Decentralized Oracle Network has validated this trade. It's not just text; it's a proof."

## 🔴 Scenario 2: The "Live Fire" (Rugpull Defense)
**Goal:** Show Aegis saving the user from a scam.

1.  **The Hook:** "Now, let's try to buy a known scam token. A normal AI agent would just execute this and lose your money."
2.  **Action:** Type:
    ```
    buy fail token
    ```
    *(Or `buy scam`, `buy honeypot`)*
3.  **Narration (while scanning):**
    *   "Aegis detects the contract is a **Honeypot**."
    *   "It sees the **Ownership is not renounced**."
4.  **The Climax:**
    *   Watch the UI turn **RED**.
    *   **The Verdict:** "Threat Detected. Transaction Blocked."
    *   "Aegis cryptographically refused to sign this transaction. The AI literally *cannot* move the funds."

## 📜 Technical Deep Dive (If Judges Ask)
*   **"How do you know it's signed?"**
    *   Show `VerdictCard` hash: "This hash is generated by the DON private key."
*   **"Is this live?"**
    *   "Yes, we are querying real APIs (CoinGecko, GoPlus) in real-time."
